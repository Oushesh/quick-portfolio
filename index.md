## Artistic Engineering (inspired by the likes: )
   1. Machine Learning Data Annotation is a boring job for the annotators nonetheless really important for any AI first company. At my current company, I proposed to enhance the 
   segmentation process and alleviate the boring tasks of 
   annotators and simultaneously saving lots of money in the process.

   2. Data Capturing via Video   
      I have always been of the belief that an AI company should 
      have a video data capturing pipeline rather than an image based one. In principle, one can gather more insights
      and see how ML models perform in practice and even write automated insight tools for that purpose.

      For this example I inspired to develop a video data gathering tool with semi-automatic segmentation tool.
      Here the object was: shoes.
